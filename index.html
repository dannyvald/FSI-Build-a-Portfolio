     <H3>About Me</H3>
     <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, CA and always had a passion for the arts. Wether it was being behind a drumset,
       drawing or making mud tunels in my backyard, the impulse to create was always part of me. Now as an adult and having had lived out my dream 
       of touring thanks to music; marrying the woman of my dreams and having 2 beautiful daughters, I can say this new programming adventure is just a continuation of my creative process.
