      Directions:
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

     <p>My <em>favorite</em> thing about programming is being able to manipulate pages to look and do as I want.</p>

     <H3>About Me</H3>
     <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, CA and always had a passion for the arts. Wether it was being behind a drumset,
       drawing or making mud tunels in my backyard, the impulse to create was always part of me. Now as an adult and having had lived out my dream 
       of touring thanks to music; marrying the woman of my dreams and having 2 beautiful daughters, I can say this new programming adventure is just a continuation of my creative process.
